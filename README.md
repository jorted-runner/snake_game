# LAN Multiplayer Snake Game

This game is a cooperative twist on the classic snake game. In this version, you and a friend team up to achieve the highest score possible. Each player has the ability to deploy a portal, and effective use of these portals requires teamwork, as each player can control only one portal.

## Technical Details

This version of the snake game uses sockets and a local area network (LAN) to connect players to the game server. The server is capable of handling multiple two-player games simultaneously by managing and distributing the correct game instances to each client.
