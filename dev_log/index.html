    <h2>What is Viper Vortex?</h2>
    <p>Viper Vortex will be an online realtime co-operative multiplayer game. It is a twist on the traditional snake game. You will be playing alongside one other player. The game will end when you either run into the other player, the walls, or you finally fill up the screen. The twist is that you and your partner can create and deploy portals to allow you to more easily move around the screen. Each player will control one of the portals and you will have to work together to deploy your portals in the best way possible.</p>
